## âœ… Features âœ…
***

*The following are the main features of this application:*
  * The API has the following endpoints:
    * `/login`
      * Method: POST
        * Body => `email`(required),`password`(required)
        * returns the created user and the jwt token 
    * `/signup`
      * Method: POST
        * Body => `name`(required),`email`(required),`password`(required)
        * returns the created user and the jwt

        * returns a secret message that is only accessible if user is authenticated

The frontend:

## ðŸ’­ Reflections ðŸ’­
***
This project was a bit of a race to complete. I was sick throughout the production so couldn't really do all I wanted. But nevertheless I managed to explore some new concepts like: JWT tokens and `createAsyncThunk`. 
I feel like I learned a lot in this project, and will most likely bring some of this code with me to my final project.

<br>

Issues that came up:
- Just lack of time and energy due to illness


If I were to continue on this project / start over I would:
- Look into persiting the token using Http only cookies. I will probably do this in my final project using Auth0.
